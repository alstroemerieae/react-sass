# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run sass`

It will “watch” all the sass files for changes and compile them to the css folder real time.\
The “no source map” flag, keeps it from generating the file that shows how the files are mapped together (less clutter).
